I kept myself in a bubble for years, afraid to try new things because I was petrified of failure and didn't trust myself to succeed. Teacher Training was a big leap of faith for me--one of the biggest I had ever taken--and when I came out on the other side with a dream accomplished, it gave me a self assurance I had never had.", "source"=>"Ginni Beam");
